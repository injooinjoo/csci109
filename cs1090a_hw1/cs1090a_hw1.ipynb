    "9. Wrap-up (5 pts)\n",

    "- Plots should be legible and interpretable *without having to refer to the code that generated them*. They should include labels for the $x$- and $y$-axes as well as a descriptive title and/or legend when appropriate.\n",
    "- When asked to interpret a visualization, do not simply describe it (e.g., \"the curve has a steep slope up\"), but instead explain what you believe the plot *means*.\n",
    "- Autograding tests are mostly to help you debug. The tests are not exhaustive so simply passing all tests may not be sufficient for full credit.\n",
    "- The use of *extremely* inefficient or error-prone code (e.g., copy-pasting nearly identical commands rather than looping) may result in only partial credit.\n",
    "- We have tried to include all the libraries you may need to do the assignment in the imports cell provided below. Please get course staff approval before importing any additional 3rd party libraries.\n",
    "- Enable scrolling output on cells with very long output. Or better yet, avoid overly long output altogether.\n",
    "- Feel free to add additional code or markdown cells as needed.\n",
    "- Don't forget to include a written response when one is requested by a question prompt.\n",
    "- Ensure your code runs top to bottom without error and passes all tests by restarting the kernel and running all cells (note that this can take a few minutes). \n",
